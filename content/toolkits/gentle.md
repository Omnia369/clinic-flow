## Core Components

### 1. New Patient Welcome Email Series
*   **Goal:** Onboard new patients smoothly and set clear expectations.
*   **Sequence:** A 3-part email series sent over the first week:
    1.  **Day 1 (Post-Visit):** "Welcome & What to Expect Next" - Reassures them about any post-adjustment soreness and reinforces the doctor's advice.
    2.  **Day 3:** "Meet Our Team & Philosophy" - Builds a personal connection.
    3.  **Day 7:** "Your First Week Progress & FAQs" - Answers common questions and encourages them to book their next appointment.

### 2. "What is a Subluxation?" Explainer Video/Article
*   **Goal:** Demystify chiropractic concepts for new patients.
*   **Content:** A simple, easy-to-understand piece of content that explains the core concepts of chiropractic care.
*   **Distribution:** Linked in the welcome email series and available on the website.

### 3. Care Plan Adherence Check-ins
*   **Goal:** Gently remind patients to follow through on their recommended care plan.
*   **Trigger:** Automated message sent if a patient hasn't booked their next recommended appointment within a certain timeframe.
*   **Copy Snippet:** "Hi [Patient Name], just a gentle reminder from [Clinic Name] to book your next visit to stay on track with your care plan. You can book online here: [Link]"

## Setup & Configuration
*   **Email Marketing Platform:** (e.g., Mailchimp, ConvertKit) to build the automated welcome series.
*   **CRM/Scheduling System:** To track patient visit history and trigger the care plan reminders.

## Metrics
*   **KPI:** New patient drop-off rate (percentage of new patients who don't return for a second visit); care plan adherence rate.
*   **Instrumentation:** Track open and click rates on the welcome email series.
