## Core Components

### 1. "Ask Me Anything" (AMA) with the Doctor on Social Media
*   **Goal:** Engage the local community, build the doctor's personal brand, and generate new patient leads.
*   **Platform:** Instagram Live, Facebook Live, or a local community Facebook group.
*   **Format:** A scheduled 30-minute live session where the doctor answers questions from the audience in real-time.

### 2. Pilot a New Service Offering
*   **Goal:** Test demand for a new, complementary service (e.g., nutrition coaching, corporate wellness workshops, ergonomic assessments).
*   **Approach:**
    1.  Define a Minimum Viable Service (MVS).
    2.  Offer it to a small segment of existing, trusted patients at an introductory rate.
    3.  Gather feedback and testimonials before a wider rollout.

### 3. A/B Test Your Website's Main Headline
*   **Goal:** Improve the conversion rate of your website's homepage.
*   **Tools:** Google Optimize, VWO, or a simple A/B testing feature in your website builder.
*   **Test:** Run a test comparing your current headline with a new, benefit-driven alternative (e.g., "Chiropractic Care in [City]" vs. "Find Relief from Back Pain and Headaches in [City]").

## Setup & Configuration
*   **Social Media:** Active and engaged social media profiles.
*   **Email List:** To announce the pilot program to a segment of patients.
*   **A/B Testing Tool:** To run the website headline test.

## Metrics
*   **KPI:** Engagement rate on social media AMAs; sign-up rate for the pilot service; conversion rate lift from the A/B test.
*   **Instrumentation:** Track website conversions; use a unique sign-up link for the pilot program.
