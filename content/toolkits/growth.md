## Core Components

### 1. New Patient Offer
*   **Goal:** Convert website visitors and social media followers into new patients.
*   **Offer:** A compelling, low-friction introductory offer (e.g., "$49 New Patient Special: Consultation, Exam, and First Adjustment").
*   **Placement:** Prominently featured on the website homepage, social media profiles, and in local ads.

### 2. Service Spotlight Email Series
*   **Goal:** Educate existing patients about other services they might not be aware of (e.g., massage therapy, nutrition counseling, spinal decompression).
*   **Audience:** Segment of existing patients who have only used one type of service.
*   **Template:** A 3-part email drip campaign introducing the service, its benefits, and a special offer for their first session.

### 3. Local SEO & Google Business Profile Optimization
*   **Goal:** Rank higher in local search results for "chiropractor near me" and related terms.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Ensure Google Business Profile is fully filled out with accurate hours, services, and photos.
    *   Actively solicit Google Reviews from happy patients.
    *   Build local citations and backlinks.

## Setup & Configuration
*   **Website:** Requires the ability to add a prominent call-to-action banner.
*   **CRM/Email Marketing:** Needs patient segmentation capabilities.
*   **Google Business Profile:** Requires admin access.
