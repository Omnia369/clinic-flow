## Core Components

### 1. Care Plan Milestone Check-ins
*   **Goal:** Celebrate progress and keep patients motivated.
*   **Flow:** Automated emails or SMS messages sent at key milestones in their care plan (e.g., after the 5th visit, at the 1-month mark).
*   **Content:** Congratulates them on their progress, reminds them of the initial goals, and provides encouragement for the next phase.

### 2. "Between Visit" Educational Drips
*   **Goal:** Provide value and keep the clinic top-of-mind between appointments.
*   **Content:** A series of automated emails with simple, helpful content related to their condition (e.g., "3 Stretches for a Healthier Back", "Improving Your Desk Ergonomics").
*   **Timing:** Sent a few days after an appointment.

### 3. End-of-Care-Plan Summary & Next Steps
*   **Goal:** Ensure a smooth transition for patients finishing their initial care plan.
*   **Content:** An email that summarizes their progress, celebrates their achievements, and clearly outlines the options for ongoing wellness or maintenance care.
*   **Call-to-Action:** Encourages them to book a "wellness check-in" in 3-6 months.

## Setup & Configuration
*   **CRM/EHR:** Must have the ability to track patient progress through a defined care plan (e.g., number of visits, date of first visit).
*   **Email Marketing Platform:** To build the automated email sequences.

## Metrics
*   **KPI:** Care plan completion rate; patient lifetime value (LTV).
*   **Instrumentation:** Track engagement with the educational drip content; monitor re-booking rates for wellness care.
