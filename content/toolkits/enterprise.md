## Core Components

### 1. Centralized Performance Dashboard
*   **Goal:** Give owners a single pane of glass to view key metrics across all locations.
*   **Metrics:** New patients per location, revenue per provider, no-show rates by clinic, patient satisfaction scores.
*   **Tools:** Google Data Studio, Tableau, or a custom dashboard pulling data from a centralized data warehouse.

### 2. Standardized Staff Onboarding & Training
*   **Goal:** Ensure consistent patient experience and operational procedures across all locations.
*   **Content:** A digital library of training materials, SOPs, and compliance checklists (e.g., HIPAA).
*   **Platform:** A shared Notion or Google Drive folder, or a dedicated Learning Management System (LMS).

### 3. HIPAA Compliance & BAA Management
*   **Goal:** Systematically manage compliance and vendor agreements.
*   **Process:**
    *   Regular HIPAA risk assessments.
    *   A centralized repository of all Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with vendors.
    *   Automated reminders for BAA renewals.

## Setup & Configuration
*   **Data Warehouse:** A centralized place (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake) to aggregate data from various clinic systems.
*   **BI Tool:** A business intelligence tool for building the dashboard.
*   **Document Management System:** For storing and managing SOPs and BAAs.

## Metrics
*   **KPI:** Staff turnover rate; time-to-productivity for new hires; number of compliance incidents.
