# Slash Command Prompt Pack

This directory contains the **Slash Command Prompt Pack**, designed to be used with LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to generate high-ROI content for the clinic toolkits.

## Files
- **[v1_pack.md](./v1_pack.md):** The core prompt library, including context setters, style policies, and output definitions.

## How to Use
1. Copy the **Global Context Setter** from `v1_pack.md`.
2. Fill in the clinic's specific details.
3. Paste it into your LLM session.
4. Use the defined slash commands (e.g., `/generate`) to create consistent, on-brand marketing assets.
